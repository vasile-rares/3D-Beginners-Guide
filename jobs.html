              <p>3D art, which is computer-generated, is a complex thing. People get to see it all the time in games, movies, and TV, but in its entirety, for 3D artists, it can be a little daunting. 3D art is divided into three separate elements: Modeling(Geometry), Rendering, and Animation. Modeling and geometry are the descriptions of objects and the space they occupy. Modeling is the first step in 3D because there is nothing to render or animate without geometry and objects. Rendering is a conversion of the geometry into pixels on a screen using lights and materials, without which you would not be able to see the geometry at all. Animation adds the fourth dimension to 3D art, which is time. The values of things change over time, and the animator manages those changes by setting keyframes at certain places.</p>

              <p>The role of a 3D artist is to decode problems, but it comes after the design process. A 3D artist who obtains design skills brings more value to production through their ability to solve cognitive and abstract concepts using design as a guide. He/she should be in tune with what design is, how it will, and how,w it will profit your work. Animation studios look for 3D professionals with a traditional design background, so expanding your skillset, strengthening your work, and boosting your professional worth are advisable.</p>

              <p>1988 was the year when the movie who framed roger rabbit? was released, and the field of animation exploded. Then came Beauty and the Beast, released by Disney in 1992, which became a market sensation. A career in animation has boomed a lot since then. 3D animators use computer programs like Maya, 3D Studio Max, and Houdini to create 3D graphics, visual effects, and animation for various industries. People who work in 3D animation produce visual results and animated characters for movies, television, video games, and other electronic media.</p>

              <p>Graphic designers create product illustrations, logos, business cards, letterheads, and posters for companies. In short, they create a complete brand that a company or client requires. Computer programs like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Cinema 4D produce visual concepts that convey messages.</p>

              <p>Web designers focus on both design and functionality. They know how to create websites and terms such as SEO(Search Engine Optimization), HTML 5, and CMS(content management system). A website is not only about visuals but also driven by user experience design. A good website designed by a web designer includes a planned information architecture, a user-friendly interface, and simple navigation.</p>
