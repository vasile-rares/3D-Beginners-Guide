              <p class="first">Welcome to the exciting world of 3D design! This Getting Started guide will provide you with essential information and resources to kickstart your journey into the realm of three-dimensional creation. Whether you're an aspiring artist, a hobbyist, or simply curious about 3D, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools to begin your exploration.</p>
              
              <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>The basic idea of 3D modeling is to create three-dimensional shapes which are then visualized in different ways. The final result may be a static scene rendered from a specific angle, or a detailed model that can be examined from all angles.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>
                <p>When working with 3D, you usually start with a basic geometric shape (a cube, sphere, cylinder, etc.), and start tweaking it with various modifiers until it resembles what you're trying to create. Of course, that's an overly simplified version—in reality, most complex models are comprised of multiple separate smaller shapes that are tweaked individually.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>
                <p>The main workflow revolves around modifying those shapes on several levels. You can either move the whole object around (or apply various other transformations to it, like resizing or rotating it), or you can break it down into its components and work with them.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>
                <p>For example, with a cube, you may select one of its sides and modify it. You could even select just one edge of that side, or work with individual vertices (the corner points that connect edges). Various modifiers can help you apply major transformations to those shapes without too much effort.</p>
              </div>

              <h1>Should You Use Free or Commercial 3D Modeling Software?</h1>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>A decade or so ago, 3D modeling was considered a field that required expensive commercial software to get into. The main suites on the market are still popular today—3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, Houdini, and others. Blender, basically the only viable software that's completely free, existed back then but was far from the Blender that many of us know now.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Today, Blender can easily compete with the big players on the market in terms of features, UI/UX, ease of use, and community support. In fact, even some studios have started to specifically look for experts in Blender, which was not the case some time ago.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>With that in mind, if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a commercial package, Blender is the way to go. It can take you as far as the other popular choices on the market. Blender will likely get even more popular in the near future, as development continues at an active pace.</p>
              </div>

              <h1>Hardware Requirements for 3D Modeling</h1>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>One major perceived disadvantage of 3D modeling is that it requires beefy hardware to even get started. That's not the case anymore.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Even a mediocre computer with an integrated graphics card can run popular 3D editors like Blender. Editing might be a bit slow when working with complex modifiers or when your scene gets very large, but you likely won't be doing any of that when you're first starting.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>For rendering, a better computer directly equates to faster rendering times. This means that you can get away with an underpowered computer, as long as you have the patience to wait for your renders to finish.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Keep in mind that the difference in speed can be quite staggering. A computer with a modern graphics card like an RTX 3070 may be able to render a scene in seconds, when a computer with older hardware may need several days.</p>
              </div>

              <h1>Choosing a Specific Field in 3D Modeling</h1>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Once you've covered the basics, you'll come to a scary realization: 3D modeling is a huge field. There are literally at least a dozen subdisciplines you can spend months exploring:</p>

              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Those are just some examples. The important thing to remember is that you don’t have to learn all of them.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>Typically, you will choose a specific direction and work on that. For example, you might want to become an animator or even an environment artist who renders massive scenes. In any case, just relax—the amount of knowledge you need is not as much as it seems once you've figured out exactly what you want to do.</p>
              </div>

              <h1>Learn With a Commercial Goal in Mind</h1>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>If you've decided that you want to pursue 3D modeling for financial gains and not just as a creative hobby, you'll want to direct your focus to some specific areas. Selling static models is a good entry point, though the market for that is quite crowded.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>You can also look into selling your renders in different forms, like traditional art (for example, prints or t-shirts). Game development is also a huge field where 3D modelers are in constant demand.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="highlight">
                <p>In any case, you should take a good look at the market you're about to enter, and figure out the core skills required to succeed. Each specific area of 3D modeling is unique in this regard, and you'll have to spend some time exploring until you've found what you want to do.</p>
